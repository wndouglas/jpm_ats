## Description

Write a programme in Java that simulates the process of replying to rfqs from clients for a 10y swap.

The application should, for example, construct a ticking 10y swap mid price and order book (for example 
from a random process generator â€“ nice to have would be to simulate bund and asset swap spread prices 
separately and then combine together to construct a 10y price), simulate rfqs arriving at random intervals 
with size and direction and reply back with the corresponding price. If possible, implement the pricing 
and the rfq processes on 2 separate threads of the program. You should also log the working of the 
application (pricing, rfq events and prices, etc) to a log file (or simply print them to the console). 
Finally, try to build the program as a jar that can be run from the command line.

## Solution

My solution to this problem is a Java program modelling the Bund bond yield and the asset swap spread as separate
mid-rate processes (currently a Vasicek model or a Geometric Brownian motion model are supported). The bond yield
and swap spread models run in two separate ***pricing*** threads which update a central ***data manager*** which
can be queried for a swap mid-rate. Two other threads: an ***RFQ request thread*** and an ***RFQ response thread*** 
produce ***RFQ events*** which are submitted/consumed from an RFQ event queue. The RFQ requests are produced at
random intervals dictated by a max RFQ request rate and at a random notional (in millions) dictated by the max RFQ 
notional. A spread is then applied to the mid-rate dependent on the size of the RFQ, ranging between a hardcoded minimum
and maximum spread (1bps-10bps). All pricing updates and RFQ requests/responses are logged to the specified locations
(console and/or log file).

### Building the code

To build the code from source, ensure you have Maven installed on your machine. Run 

` mvn clean install`

from within the top level folder ***jpm_ats***. This will build the required jar file
***jpm_ats-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar***. There is a small set of unit-tests
included which will be executed when running the above command.

### Running the code

The code expects 3 flags:

```
    -c (--config): Mandatory flag followed by the absolute path to a config file (e.g. C:\config\config.json
    -e (--enableConsoleLog): Flag to stream logger results to std out.
    -l (--logPath): Flag to stream results to a log file, followed by absolute file path.
```

The log file must take the following form:

```json
{
  "swapSpreadRefreshRate": 2,
  "bondYieldRefreshRate": 3,
  "maxRfqRefreshRate": 10,
  "rfqRequestRandomTimeSeed": 0,
  "maxRfqNotional": 100,
  "rfqRequestRandomNotionalSeed": 1,
  "swapSpreadModel": {
    "modelType": "Vasicek",
    "initialValue": 0.008,
    "annualisedVol": 0.5,
    "longTermMean": 0.01,
    "meanReversionSpeed": 0.5,
    "seed": 2
  },
  "bondYieldModel": {
    "modelType": "GBM",
    "initialValue": 0.012,
    "annualisedVol": 0.7,
    "annualisedMeanDrift": 0.02,
    "seed": 3
  }
}
```

All parameters above are mandatory and represent the following:

* ```swapSpreadRefreshRate```: A positive integer. The rate (in seconds) at which the swap spread simulator produces new swap spread ticks.
* ```bondYieldRefreshRate```: A positive integer. The rate (in seconds) at which the bond yield simulator produces new bond yield ticks.
* ```maxRfqRefreshRate```: A positive integer. RFQs are submitted at random using a uniform number generator. This value represents the max 
rate (in seconds) at which RFQs are submitted.
* ```rfqRequestRandomTimeSeed```: A positive integer. The seed for the max RFQ refresh rate unform random number generator.
* ```maxRfqNotional```: A positive integer. RFQs are submitted at a random size dictated by a uniform number generator. This value 
represents the max size (in millions) at which RFQs are submitted.
* ```rfqRequestRandomNotionalSeed```: A positive integer. The seed for the max RFQ notional request uniform
random number generator.
* ```swapSpreadModel```/```bondYieldModel```: A stochastic model for simulating the two price processes. Currently 
a Vasicek or GBM (Geometric Brownian Motion) model are supported.

##### Vasicek model
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasicek_model.
* ```modelType```: 'Vasicek'
* ```initialValue```: Positive double representing the initial rate/price for the Vasicek process.
* ```annualisedVol```: Positive double representing the annualised volatility for the Vasicek process.
* ```longTermMean```: Double representing the long term annualised mean for the Vasicek process.
* ```meanReversionSpeed```: Positive double representing the annualised mean reversion speed for the Vasicek process.
* ```seed```: Positive integer representing the seed for the driving standard normal process for the Vasicek process.

##### Geometric Brownian motion model
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion.
* ```modelType```: 'GBM'
* ```initialValue```: Positive double representing the initial rate/price for the Vasicek process.
* ```annualisedVol```: Positive double representing the annualised volatility for the Vasicek process.
* ````annualisedMeanDrift````: Positive double representing the annualised mean drift for the Vasicek process.
* ```seed```: Positive integer representing the seed for the driving standard normal process for the Vasicek process.

Once you have configured your config file, decided on log destinations and have acquired the required
JAR file, the program can be run as follows:

```java -jar jpm_ats-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -c "C:/jpm_ats/config.json" -l "C:/jpm_ats/simulation.log" -e```

Sample config files are contained in:

```jpm_ats/src/main/config```
